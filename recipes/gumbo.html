    <h2>Good New Orleans Creole Gumbo</h2>
    <p>
      I am going to give you my Creole gumbo recipe. I learned to cook from my
      mother and grandmother who were born and raised in New Orleans and really
      knew how to cook. Most of the time, you could not get them to write down
      their recipes because they used a 'pinch' of this and 'just enough of
      that' and 'two fingers of water,' and so on. This recipe is a combination
      of both of their recipes which I have added to over the years. Serve over
      hot cooked rice. The gumbo can be frozen or refrigerated and many people
      like it better the next day. Bon appetit!
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>Â¾ cup bacon drippings</li>
      <li>1 cup coarsely chopped celery</li>
      <li>1 large onion, coarsely chopped</li>
      <li>1 large green bell pepper, coarsely chopped</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 pound andouille sausage, sliced</li>
      <li>3 quarts water</li>
      <li>6 cubes beef bouillon</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
      <li>salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Make the roux: Whisk together flour and 3/4 cup bacon drippings in a
        large, heavy saucepan over medium-low heat until smooth. Cook roux,
        whisking constantly, until it turns a rich mahogany brown color. This
        can take 20 to 30 minutes; watch heat carefully and whisk constantly or
        roux will burn. Remove from heat; continue whisking until mixture stops
        cooking.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make the gumbo: Place celery, onion, green bell pepper, and garlic into
        the work bowl of a food processor, and pulse until all vegetables are
        very finely chopped. Stir vegetables into the roux, and mix in sausage.
        Bring mixture to a simmer over medium-low heat, and cook until
        vegetables are tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine water and beef bouillon cubes in a large Dutch oven or soup pot
        and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Stir until bouillon cubes
        dissolve, then whisk roux mixture into the boiling water.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce heat to a simmer and mix in sugar, salt, hot pepper sauce, Cajun
        seasoning, bay leaves, thyme, stewed tomatoes, and tomato sauce. Simmer
        soup over low heat for 1 hour; mix in 2 teaspoons of file gumbo powder
        at the 45-minute mark.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, melt 2 tablespoons bacon drippings in a skillet over medium
        heat. Add okra and vinegar and cook for 15 minutes; remove okra with a
        slotted spoon, and stir into the simmering gumbo.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix in reserved vegetables, crabmeat, shrimp, and Worcestershire sauce,
        and simmer until flavors have blended, 45 more minutes. Stir in 2 more
        teaspoons of file gumbo powder just before serving.
      </li>
    </ol>
